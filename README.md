This where the development of the system will take place. please read the README file


I take it you guys are familiar with github and git, if not please use Youtube for things that doesn't make sense.

We will send regular commits here, if you feel like there are certain changes or issues that you'd like to make of fix on a certain file please fork the repo then create a separate branch that you will work on and make changes on, then push the changes to the forked repo, then send a pull request we will then decide if we accept your changes or not, if we accept them we will merge your branch with the main branch. 

Happy coding!
